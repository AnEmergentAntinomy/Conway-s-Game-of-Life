# Conway's Game of Life
A random Conway's Game of Life simulator based on the Forest Fire model on scipython.com

The code for forestfire_model.py came from https://scipython.com/blog/the-forest-fire-model/

game_of_life.py is that same code just modified to use Conway's rules.

The show_new and show_dead options can each be set to True or False to display the newest cells or the dead cells of each iteration.
